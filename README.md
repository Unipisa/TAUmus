# TAUmus

### TAUmus is the software controlling the real-time computer-music system TAU2-TAUMUS, developed in the 70's of the XX century at the IEE and CNUCE in Pisa under the leadership of Maestro [P. Grossi](https://github.com/Unipisa/TAUmus-Workbench/blob/master/metadata/actors.md#pietro-grossi).  

This branch stores a small excerpt of the development history of the source code: some samples of session scripts that use the TAUmus commands to generate computer music on the audio-terminal TAU2 and a few IBM 360 FORTRAN files from the TAUmus command interpreter itself.
