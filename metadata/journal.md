## DIUNIPI SWH DEPOSITORY/JOURNAL.md Template

Here we propose a template for JOURNAL<span>.md for Depository of DIUNIPI SWH Acquisition Process.

Each action on the Depository should have a corresponding record on the JOURNAL<span>.md with the structure below.

Please note that:
* Name and Surname of actors should be linked to their paragraph in [ACTORS.md](./ACTORS.md) file;
* Items should be linked to the file [inside the repository](./MATERIAL/);
* We recommend to use only one of the following roles for each record: Author, Collector, Curator;
* Dated records are from the newest to the oldest (new records written on top of the list);
* Notes are optional.

Example of Actor link:

[Name Surname](./ACTORS.md#name-surname)
